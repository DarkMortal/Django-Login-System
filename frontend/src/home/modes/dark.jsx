            <p className="mb-8 leading-relaxed" style={{textAlign:"justify"}}>Vegito's personality is a mixture of both Goku and Vegeta's characteristics. He exhibits Vegeta's cockiness and inclination for taunting others, and enjoys toying with enemies, but is not as serious, having inherited Goku's easygoing, cheerful nature. 
                      He possesses both Vegeta's strategic mind and tactical skills along with Goku's ingenuity and creativity, making him that much more efficient. Despite appearing cocky, he in fact retains Goku's benevolence and empathy. Being a whole new entity, he refers to his counterparts as separate people as they would address each other. 
                      During his fight with Super Buu, Vegito also showed signs of having a sense of humor, such as after Buu transformed Vegito into candy, Vegito claimed he wasn't no ordinary candy, but a jawbreaker and the "strongest candy there is".</p>

                His opinion on his Saiyan heritage kept varying through the course of Z. 
                Furthermore, when Goku first discovered his Saiyan heritage, he rejected it out of horror and disgust at being from a race of vicious killers, though he started to embrace his heritage after Vegeta's speech against Frieza on Namek had inspired him to avenge the loss of all those killed by Frieza, including his Saiyan race. </p>

              <p className="text-base leading-relaxed mt-2" style={{textAlign:"justify"}}>Regal, egotistical, and full of pride, Vegeta was once a ruthless, cold-blooded warrior and outright killer, but later abandons his role in the Frieza Force, instead opting to remain and live on Earth. 
                Vegeta's character development is the most praised and one of the biggest in the series. Originally in the Dragon Ball Z anime, Vegeta appeared with a totally different color scheme from his usual one, having red hair and a battle armor consisting of a green khaki chest piece and burnt orange guard pieces, orange gloves, a navy blue jumpsuit, and his boots with orange tops and brown footings to them. This color scheme also appears as an alternate color for his Battle Armor in various video games.</p>

                When he was a kid, he wore a black one-strap tunic with gray pants and brown boots, alongside a rope belt and bracelets. As an adult, Broly is towering man with a lean but well-built frame. 
                His facial expression, even before wearing the crown, had a melancholic demeanor to it. He is shirtless while wearing white pants with a red sash draped around his waist and secured by a yellow belt with a blue gem-center.</p>
